## Concepts

[`Categories`](#concept:categories){ #concept:categories }
:   Tickets are organised into categories that you create (such as ban appeals, staff applications, billing support etc).

	Since v4, ticket and Discord categories are separate.
	Multiple ticket categories can belong to a single Discord channel category.

[`Panels`](#concept:panels){ #concept:panels }
:   Unlike some other bots, panels are not a central concept in Discord Tickets.
	Tickets belong to categories, and a panel is one of several ways you can create a ticket.

[`Staff`](#concept:staff){ #concept:staff }
:	A staff member is any member who has at least 1 role that is assigned to any ticket category within the guild.
