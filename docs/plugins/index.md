# Plugins

Plugins allow you to extend the functionality of Discord Tickets without modifying the original code, making updating and removing modifications easy. They can create new commands, override the default commands, and listen for events from the Discord Client and the Ticket Manager.

[Official plugins](./official) are those that are officially maintained and supported. Additional [community plugins](./community) can add features that meat more specific needs.

## Creating a plugin

Read the [plugins developer guide](../../developers/plugins).
