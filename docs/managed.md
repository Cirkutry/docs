## FAQs

### Why are there two plans?

Both plans run the same code, the only difference is that archiving is disabled on the Basic plan.
This is because **the majority of storage costs are from archiving** (storing transcripts).
**If you aren't going to use this feature, your bot will be cheaper to host.**

!!! abstract ""
	£3/month is already quite cheap, especially considering you're paying for my time to manage the technical side so you don't have to.
	The Basic plan exists so **you can pay even less if you don't need the most expensive feature**.

### Which plan should I choose?

??? question "Do you need the archiving feature?"
	=== "Yes"
		Choose the **Professional** plan
	=== "No"
		Choose the **Basic** or the **Professional** plan

??? question "Do you have a domain name?"
	=== "Yes"
		Choose the **Professional** plan
	=== "No"
		Choose the **Basic** or the **Professional** plan

### Can my bot have a custom status/activity?

Yes, you can specify custom activities when you create a ticket.
Check [the documentation](./self-hosting/configuration.md#presence) for available placeholders.

### Can I pay with PayPal?

**Yes, but card payments are preferred** because the fees are lower.
If PayPal is supported in your country, you'll see a PayPal button on the checkout page.

### Can I pay with crypto?

If you are unable to pay by card or PayPal and need to pay with crypto, you must pre-pay for a year and manually renew your plan.
Create a ticket to get your bot as there is no automation for non-Stripe payments.
