### FAQs

#### Why are there two plans?

Both plans run exactly the same code, the only difference is that archiving is disabled on the Basic plan.

!!! abstract ""
	£3/month is already quite cheap, especially considering **you're paying for my time to install and update your bot so you don't have to.**
	The Basic plan exists so **you can pay even less if you don't need all of the features**.

#### Why do archives cost extra?

- Archiving dramatically increases CPU and database/storage usage
- Not everyone needs archives, so it would be unfair to make everyone pay more

Instead of thinking of it as archives costing more, think of it as you can save money by not using archives if you don't need to.

#### Which plan should I choose?

??? question "Do you need the archiving feature?"
	=== "Yes"
		Choose the **Professional** plan
	=== "No"
		Choose the **Basic** or the **Professional** plan

??? question "Do you have an FQDN (domain name)?"
	=== "Yes"
		Choose the **Professional** plan
	=== "No"
		Choose the **Basic** or the **Professional** plan

#### Can my bot have a custom status/activity?

Yes, you can specify custom activities when you create a ticket.
Check [the documentation](./self-hosting/configuration.md#presence) for available placeholders.

#### Can I pay with PayPal?

No. Subscription payments are securely processed through [Stripe](https://stripe.com),
which accepts all major credit and debit cards.

#### Can I pay with crypto?

If you want to pay with crypto, you must pre-pay for a year and manually renew your plan.
You'll need to create a ticket to get your bot as there is no automation for non-Stripe payments.
