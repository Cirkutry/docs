# Pterodactyl

!!! warning
	**If you are going to host Discord Tickets with a third-party hosting provider** rather than on your own server:

	-  You are more likely to encounter rate limits.
	-  If the hosting provider does not offer a reverse proxy service,
		you won't be able to use a domain name with SSL/TLS,
		which is strongly recommended.
