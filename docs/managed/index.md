### FAQs

#### Why are there two plans?

Both plans run exactly the same code, the only differences are in configuration:

1. Archiving is disabled in the Standard plan
2. The portal is not installed in the Standard plan

!!! abstract
	£3/month is already quite cheap, especially considering **you're paying for my time to install and update your bot so you don't have to.**
	The Standard plan exists so **you can pay even less if you don't need all of the features**.

#### Why do archives cost extra?

- Archiving dramatically increases CPU and database/storage usage
- Hosting & updating the portal requires more of my time
- Not everyone needs archives, so it would be unfair to make everyone pay more

Instead of thinking of it as archives costing more, think of it as you can save money by not using archives if you don't need to.

#### Why can't I view feedback?

Users **can** submit feedback on the Standard plan, but the portal is currently the only way to view feedback, so you cannot view it.

#### Which plan should I choose?

??? question "Do you need the archiving feature?"
	=== "Yes"
		Choose the **Premium** plan
	=== "No"
		Choose the **Standard** or the **Premium** plan

??? question "Do you need the feedback feature?"
	=== "Yes"
		Choose the **Premium** plan to be able to view feedback
	=== "No"
		Choose the **Standard** or the **Premium** plan

#### What happens after I pay?
