# Getting started

Discord Tickets was originally made to be self-hosted, but if you don't have a server you can pay for [managed hosting](/hosting).

## Self-host vs managed

Managed hosting is the easiest way to get your ticket bot running.
If you already have a server, you should [self-host](/installation). If you have no experience in hosting things and don't have a server, get [managed hosting](/hosting).
