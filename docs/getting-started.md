# Getting started

!!! danger "Important"
	**Before you start:** this documentation took [the contributors](https://github.com/discord-tickets/docs/graphs/contributors) many hours to write.
	**Please read it**{ .red }, so we don't waste several more hours answering questions that can easily be avoided. :+1:
