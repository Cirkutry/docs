# Getting started

Discord Tickets was originally made to be self-hosted, but if you don't have a server you can pay for [managed hosting](/hosting).

## Before you start

Before you install the bot:

1. [Create your Discord bot application](/getting-your-bot-token)
2. [Add your bot to Discord](/invite-url-generator)

## Getting your bot running

### Hosting

If you have your own server you can [install the bot](/installation) yourself. If you'd prefer the easier option, you can get [managed hosting](/hosting).

[Self-hosting](/installation){ .md-button .md-button--primary } [Managed hosting](/hosting){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

### Configuration

You need to [configure](/configuration/post-install) your bot (if self-hosting). You can then [change your guild settings](/configuration/guild-settings/) and set up your ticket categories.
