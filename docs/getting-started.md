## Self hosting

**Follow the instructions for your chosen installation method:**

1. [Standard installation](/installation/standard)
2. [Docker installation](/installation/docker)
3. [Pterodactyl installation](/installation/pterodactyl)

### Hosting providers

If you don't already have a suitable host you can use one of these suggested hosting providers.

- [**PebbleHost**](https://billing.pebblehost.com/aff.php?aff=1841)

	PebbleHost offers shared Discord bot hosting with "pre-installs" including Discord Tickets.
<!-- - [**Hetzner**]() -->
- [**Managed hosting**](#managed-hosting)

	Buy hosting directly from the creator of Discord Tickets to get your bot running with minimal effort.

## Managed hosting

If you just want a ticket bot without the complications of hosting, maintaining, and updating it, you can get [managed hosting](/hosting) - meaning all of the hard work is done for you.
