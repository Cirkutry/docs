# Category questions

!!! bug ""
    The settings panel has a fully functional editor for select-menu-type questions,
    but select menus are *still* not supported in Discord modals so are disabled.
    They may be implemented outside of modals soon: discord-tickets/bot#446.

## Custom topic

The question options are very self-explanatory.
Note that if you provide a `value`, it **must** satisfy the min/max length constraints.
