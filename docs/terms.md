# Terms of service, user agreement, and disclaimers

!!! quote
	As you can almost certainly tell, this document wasn't written nor reviewed by a legal professional.

	I'll try my best to provide good services in compliance with the law, and I ask that as a user of those services,
	you be kind, do not try to ruin the services, and don't take legal action against me.
	Thanks! :slight_smile:

!!! info
	These terms do not apply to the open-source software itself (only to the hosted services),
	with the exception that, [unless disabled](./self-hosting/configuration.md#stats),
	the Discord Tickets Bot automatically connects to Discord Tickets StatsAPI.

	Please read the `LICENSE` file located in the root directory of the git repository for the open-source software you are using.

These terms and conditions apply to all services provided by me under the "Discord Tickets" brand and are governed by the law of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
This document may be changed at any time.
If you do not accept these terms (or [the privacy policy](./privacy.md#service-privacy-policy)), do not use any of the services.

## 1. Definitions

Throughout this document, "I", "me"/"my", and "eartharoid" refer to the creator, [Isaac Saunders](https://eartharoid.me/contact)
(and "we"/"our" may refer to me and my business partners).


The "services" include, but are not limited to:

- The discordtickets.app website
- The blog.discordtickets.app website

"Discord Tickets Bot", "the bot" etc refer to the open-source software.
"Hosted bots" are public or managed bots.
## 2. Trademarks

"Eartharoid"/"eartharoid" (and the earth icon logo) are trademarks of Isaac Saunders.
"Discord Tickets" though, is not, due to infringing on a trademark of Discord Inc. *(sorry, Discord)*.

By using any of the services, you acknowledge that "Discord Tickets" is not in any way affiliated with nor endorsed by Discord/Discord Inc.,
and that you are not using or paying for a product or service of Discord Inc.

## 3. Services

By using any of the services, you accept that, unless specified otherwise, there is no warranty or guarantee provided with the service,
and I am not liable for any damages or losses (such as loss of users/members, revenue or profit, reputation etc) as a result of using or relying upon the services,
and/or the service being unavailable, malfunctioning, or not working as expected.

You accept that access to services may be revoked/terminated (from individuals, groups, or everyone)
at any time (regardless of whether the terms or policies have been breached), without reason or warning.
However, I will attempt to give reasonable prior notice and a reason if possible and not too inconvenient to myself.

### 3.1. The websites (and APIs)

#### 3.1.1. Main website and blog

The information provided on these websites is done so with good intentions,
and correct to the best of my knowledge at the time of publication, but there is no guarantee of validity.
The information is not intended to deceive or mislead readers.

By using the websites, you agree to not abuse features and bugs or APIs, and not intentionally damage the site or its infrastructure or harm the experience of other visitors.

#### 3.1.2. StatsAPI

By sending data to the StatsAPI, you agree to not knowingly send incorrect data or make excess HTTP requests in an attempt to disrupt the service, invalidate the aggregated statistics,
inflict additional cloud usage costs or send requests with any other malicious intent. 

#### 3.1.3. Proxy

The using [the proxy service](https://proxy.discordtickets.app), you acknowledge that the service is designed to encrypt data between the service and the end-user('s web browser),
and by doing so, you are allowing me to process unencrypted data. Please read [the privacy policy](./privacy.md#service-privacy-policy).
You acknowledge that whilst the origin (your server's IP) is encoded, it is not hidden by the service, and anyone can decode the URL.

By using the service, you accept that the service is provided for free to make it easier for users to self-host the Discord Tickets Bot,
and proxying anything other than the bot's internal web server (API, settings UI etc) is strictly forbidden.

##### 3.1.3.A. Fair use

The service is provided for free through an open invitation to Discord Tickets Bot users.
That invitation may be revoked without notice for any reason. Such reasons include:

- Using the service for anything other than its intended purpose
- Disproportionate or excessive bandwidth use or requests, possibly due to:
	- hosting a large number of bots
	- a large or disproportionate number of file attachments
	- too many guilds
	- too many tickets
	- too many visitors

#### 3.1.4. Feedback

You agree to not submit spam or repetitive ideas or comments.

4. bypasses restrictions or limitations
5. takes advantage of a vulnerability
6. includes accessing data that you are not permitted to
7. violates (or use the service in a Discord guild that violates)
   	the [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) or [Discord Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) -

9. would be considered unfair or abusive by a reasonable person

#### 3.2.2. Managed bots

The service may take up to a week to begin, although commonly begins within 24 hours **after you create a ticket**.
You agree that you are paying for a hosting and support service, the privilege to use free software with less hassle.
You acknowledge that you will be using the same open-source software that can be self-hosted, that such software is imperfect,
and that refunds will not be given (though may be considered for exceptional circumstances).

The "Basic" (formerly "Standard") plan comes with no guarantee of uptime or availability.
You accept that you will not be offered compensation or refunds for downtime, malfunctions, or any other problems with the service.

The "Professional" (formerly "Premium") plan comes with the following agreement:

- The service may be occasionally unavailable for short periods (typically less than 5 minutes) for upgrades/maintenance to be performed
- Scheduled downtime may last up to 15 minutes without compensation
- After the first 15 minutes of scheduled downtime, the downtime becomes unscheduled
- If requested (via a ticket, DM, or email), you may receive 15p (£0.15) of credit (on store.discordtickets.app) per 1 hour of unscheduled downtime
- You may receive a maximum of 150p (£1.50) of credit per month
- Your credit has no expiration date
