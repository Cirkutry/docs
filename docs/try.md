# Try Discord Tickets

If you're not sure if you want to spend time installing the bot, you can try it first.

<a class="md-button md-button--primary" href="https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?scope=applications.commands%20bot&permissions=126032&client_id=475371285531066368" target="_blank">Add bot to Discord :material-open-in-new:</a>

!!! warning
	The public demo bot is not verified by Discord; it leaves all guilds when it gets close to 100 guilds. You can try it for a week but please kick the bot when you are done.

!!! tip
	If you decide to install Discord Tickets afterwards but don't want to redo your settings, you can:

	1. Download the settings from the test bot
	2. Remove the `id` property from all of the `categories`
	3. Change the role IDs for each category's `roles` and `ping` properties
	4. Upload the modified settings with your newly installed bot
