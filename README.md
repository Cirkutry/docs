# Documentation

[![Netlify Build Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/f1919fde-0ef7-4b52-884f-870e354f74e4/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/discordtickets/deploys)

This is the source for the Discord Tickets v4 documentation website.

You can view the latest build of the v4 site on [the Discord Tickets website](https://discordtickets.app/).

> Note: For v3 documentation, visit [v3.discordtickets.app](https://v3.discordtickets.app) or look at the v3 branch.

## Contributing

For simple changes, you can easily create a fork, edit the files you want to change, open a PR, and see the result with the PR deploy preview from the Netlify bot.

If you want to preview locally, clone the repo and then run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and `mkdocs serve`.

## Disclaimer

If you choose to run a local preview, the site will not look the same as the production version. This is normal as the V4 documentation uses a newer version of MkDocs that is configured differently.
